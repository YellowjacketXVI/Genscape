# üö® TextLit.us 500 Error - Specific Fix Guide

## Problem Identified
The 500 error is coming from `textlit.us` hosting platform, not from your application files. This indicates a **server-side configuration issue** on the hosting platform.

## üîç Immediate Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Check Server Status
The error `GET https://textlit.us/ 500 (Internal Server Error)` suggests:
- The server is receiving requests
- But failing to process them properly
- This is a server configuration issue, not a file issue

### Step 2: Verify File Upload
First, let's confirm your files are uploaded correctly:

1. **Check if files exist**:
   - Try accessing: `https://textlit.us/test.html`
   - Try accessing: `https://textlit.us/favicon.ico`
   - Try accessing: `https://textlit.us/_expo/static/js/web/entry-ab0a117741972206b01eda7d6d06a977.js`

2. **If files return 404**: Files weren't uploaded correctly
3. **If files return 500**: Server configuration issue

## üîß TextLit.us Specific Fixes

### Fix 1: Check Upload Directory
TextLit.us might require files in a specific directory:

**Common directories:**
- `public_html/`
- `www/`
- `htdocs/`
- `web/`

**Solution**: Upload all `dist/` contents to the correct web root directory.

### Fix 2: File Permissions
TextLit.us might have strict file permission requirements:

**Required permissions:**
```bash
# Files should be readable
chmod 644 *.html *.js *.css *.json *.ico

# Directories should be executable
chmod 755 _expo/ assets/
```

### Fix 3: .htaccess Configuration
TextLit.us likely uses Apache. Ensure `.htaccess` is configured correctly:

**Create/update `.htaccess` in web root:**
```apache
# Enable rewrite engine
RewriteEngine On

# Handle Angular/React Router
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QR,L]

# Set proper MIME types
AddType application/javascript .js
AddType text/css .css
AddType application/json .json

# Enable compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/json
</IfModule>

# Security headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
</IfModule>
```

### Fix 4: PHP Configuration Issues
If TextLit.us runs PHP, there might be PHP errors:

**Check for:**
- PHP version compatibility
- Memory limits
- Execution time limits
- Error reporting settings

**Add to `.htaccess`:**
```apache
# PHP settings (if applicable)
php_value memory_limit 256M
php_value max_execution_time 300
php_value upload_max_filesize 50M
php_value post_max_size 50M
```

# 2. Drag your dist folder
# 3. Instant deployment with automatic HTTPS

# 3. Automatic SPA routing configuration
```

#### **GitHub Pages**
